# Plotly Assignment - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Step 1: Plotly

Horizontal Bar Chart
Used the D3 library to read in samples.json.
Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
Used sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
Used otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
Used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

Bubble Chart that Displays Each Sample.

Used otu_ids for the x values.
Used sample_values for the y values.
Used sample_values for the marker size.
Used otu_ids for the marker colors.
Used otu_labels for the text values.

Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
